## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/JARVIS-Assistant.git
cd JARVIS-Assistant

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Configure .env File
Username=Titash
Assistantname=Jarvis
GroqAPIKey=your_groq_api_key
EnableImageGeneration=True
InputLanguage=en-IN

### 4. Run the Assistant
python main.py
🧠 Make sure Chrome is installed, and webdriver-manager will auto-setup ChromeDriver.

🎙️ How It Works
1. Wake word ("Jarvis") is always listening
2. On detection, speech input is captured
3. The intent classifier determines what task to run
4. JARVIS either:
     Runs a system/app/media task
     Executes a content generation job
     Responds using a chatbot (Groq/GPT)
5. Output is:
     Spoken via TTS
     Displayed on GUI
